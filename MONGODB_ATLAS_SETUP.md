# MongoDB Atlas Setup (Cloud Database) - 2 Minutes! ☁️

Since local MongoDB installation has issues, let's use **MongoDB Atlas** instead - it's FREE, EASY, and FAST!

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Free Account (30 seconds)

A browser window should have opened to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register

1. **Sign up** with Google/GitHub or email
2. **Verify** your email if required
3. You'll be taken to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard

### Step 2: Create a FREE Cluster (1 minute)

1. Choose **"Build a Database"** or **"Create"**

2. Select **M0 FREE** tier:
   - ✅ **M0** - FREE FOREVER
   - 512 MB storage (plenty for development)
   - Shared RAM (perfect for testing)

3. Choose a cloud provider and region:
   - Provider: **AWS** or **Google Cloud** or **Azure** (any is fine)
   - Region: Choose one closest to you (e.g., **US East**)
   - Click **"Create"**

4. Wait ~1-2 minutes for cluster to deploy

### Step 3: Create Database User (30 seconds)

You'll see a security quickstart screen:

1. **Username:** `admin` (or anything you like)
2. **Password:** Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"**
   - 📝 **COPY THIS PASSWORD** - you'll need it!
   - Or create your own simple password like: `password123`
3. Click **"Create User"**

### Step 4: Add Your IP Address (20 seconds)

1. Under "Where would you like to connect from?"
2. Click **"Add My Current IP Address"**
   - Or click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (0.0.0.0/0) for development
3. Click **"Finish and Close"**
4. Click **"Go to Database"**

### Step 5: Get Connection String (30 seconds)

1. Click **"Connect"** button next to your cluster
2. Click **"Drivers"** or **"Connect your application"**
3. Select:
   - Driver: **Node.js**
   - Version: **5.5 or later**
4. **Copy the connection string** - it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

5. **Important:** Replace `<password>` with your actual password!

   Example:
   ```
   # If your password is: abc123
   mongodb+srv://admin:abc123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

## 📝 Step 6: Update Your .env File

I'll update it for you! Just **paste your connection string below when ready**.

### What Your Connection String Looks Like:

```
mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### After You Get It:

Run this command in your terminal (replace with YOUR actual connection string):

```powershell
$connectionString = "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
(Get-Content .env) -replace 'MONGODB_URI=.*', "MONGODB_URI=$connectionString" | Set-Content .env
```

**Or manually edit** `backend/.env` file and update the `MONGODB_URI` line.

## ✅ Test the Connection

After updating the .env file, run:

```powershell
npm run seed
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
👤 Creating users...
✅ Created 2 users
... (more success messages)
🎉 Database seeded successfully!
```

## 🎯 Quick Summary

1. ✅ Sign up at MongoDB Atlas
2. ✅ Create FREE M0 cluster (wait ~2 min)
3. ✅ Create database user & save password
4. ✅ Add your IP to whitelist
5. ✅ Get connection string
6. ✅ Replace `<password>` with your actual password
7. ✅ Update `backend/.env` file with connection string
8. ✅ Run `npm run seed`

## Alternative: If You Want to Try Local MongoDB Again

If you prefer local MongoDB, you need to:

1. Verify MongoDB installed correctly:
   - Look for MongoDB in Start menu
   - Or check: `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\`

2. Create data directory:
   ```powershell
   mkdir C:\data\db
   ```

3. Start MongoDB manually:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath C:\data\db
   ```

But honestly, **MongoDB Atlas is MUCH EASIER** and works perfectly! 😊

- ✅ Seed database with sample data
- ✅ Start backend server
- ✅ Test the complete application
- ✅ Login with sample credentials
