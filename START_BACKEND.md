## 🎯 Final Steps to Start Backend

### Step 1: Open a NEW Terminal Window

Open a **NEW PowerShell or Command Prompt** window (keep your frontend terminal running!)

### Step 2: Navigate to Backend Folder

```powershell
cd "C:\2025\Flying Chicken\Botique_Website-OCT12-V1.0-1.2-comprehensive-measurements-photos\backend"
```

### Step 3: Start the Backend Server

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Port 5000 already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Find and kill the process using port 5000:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
   ```
2. Or change the port in `backend/.env`:
   ```
   PORT=5001
   ```

### Problem: "MongoDB connection error"

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection (using MongoDB Atlas)
- Verify `.env` file has correct connection string
- Try restarting the backend server

### Problem: "Frontend can't connect to backend"

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running on port 5000
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Make sure both servers are running
4. Try refreshing the page

### Problem: "Login fails"

**Solution:**
1. Check backend terminal for errors
2. Verify database was seeded (run `npm run seed` again)
3. Use exact credentials:
   - Email: `admin@elegantstitches.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. Check browser console for errors
