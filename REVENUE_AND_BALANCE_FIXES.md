## Features Added

### Payment Balance Component Features:
1. **Order Total Display**: Shows the complete order amount
2. **Total Paid Tracking**: Calculates total payments made
3. **Balance Calculation**: Shows remaining amount to be paid
4. **Payment Status**: Visual indicators for Paid/Partial/Pending
5. **Payment History**: Complete list of all payments
6. **Add Payment**: Form to record new payments
7. **Payment Methods**: Support for multiple payment types

### Revenue Calculation Fixes:
1. **Backend Integration**: Proper API calls to fetch real data
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when API fails
3. **Data Transformation**: Correct mapping of backend to frontend data
4. **Loading States**: User feedback during data fetching
5. **Debug Logging**: Console logs for troubleshooting

## How It Works

### Revenue Calculation:
1. Frontend calls `/api/analytics/dashboard` endpoint
2. Backend returns real revenue data from database
3. Frontend displays actual revenue instead of hardcoded values
4. Falls back to local calculation if API fails

### Payment Balance:
1. Component fetches payment history for the order
2. Calculates total paid amount
3. Shows balance (Order Total - Total Paid)
4. Allows adding new payments
5. Updates payment status automatically

## Testing Steps

### Test Revenue Fix:
1. Ensure backend is running (`npm run dev` in backend folder)
2. Refresh the dashboard
3. Check browser console for API response logs
4. Verify revenue shows correct amount (₹12,100)

### Test Payment Balance:
1. Open any order details
2. Scroll to "Payment Balance" section
3. Check if balance is calculated correctly
4. Try adding a new payment
5. Verify balance updates

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/orders` - Fetch all orders
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` - Get dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/payments` - Fetch payment history
- `POST /api/payments` - Add new payment

## Error Handling

- API failures fall back to mock data
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful error messages
- Loading states for better UX

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes**: Verify revenue shows correctly
2. **Test payment balance**: Add payments and check balance
3. **Backend verification**: Ensure backend is running properly
4. **Database check**: Verify data is being fetched correctly

## Troubleshooting

If revenue still shows incorrectly:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 5000
3. Check network tab for failed API calls
4. Ensure MongoDB connection is working

If payment balance doesn't work:
1. Check console for API errors
2. Verify payment API endpoints
3. Check database for payment records
4. Test with mock data if needed
